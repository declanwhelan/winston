Winston the css fish 
=====================

Winston was an attempt I had at doing something interesting with css beyond the usual. 
I'm a fan of using css wherever possible, especially when you can replace chunks of javascript 
code with a few lines of css. Anyway, it was late on a saturday night and the SO had control of 
the tv, so Winston was born. Then he looked a bit stiff so he got some keyframe animations. Have a root around in
the source to see it's fairly easy to add winston to any page.
